# R-Zombies-Project
A zombie outbreak simulation I wrote in R for an assignment

The zombies visualisation code allows you to see a simulated zombie outbreak live in real time, manually adjust parameters and see how they affect the course of the
outbreak.

The zombies analysis code allows you to iteratively run the outbreak, and produce a graph depicting how adjusting the parameter in question affects the time it
takes for the outbreak to overcome the population.
